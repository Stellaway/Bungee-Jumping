# Bungee Jumping

This demo simulates a cuboid being released from the air while an invisible elastic rope is attached to its side, thus resulting in swinging.
The left side camera is the point of view of the object, while on the right side you can see the action from the outside. The terrain is generated using 1/f noise.
